We can use python to extract numbers using a regular expression.
```{python}
#python
import re
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

string1 = "Hello I'd like 3 dozen eggs, 10 pounds of flour, and 2 gallons of milk."

a = re.findall("\d+",string1)

```

Supposedly we can loop this through many strings and extract a dataframe of numbers, but I was having trouble accessing my dataframe in the global environment.

Now we can reference the python variable in r and edit the dataframe in r!
```{r}
#r
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)

df1 <- py$a %>% lapply(as.numeric) %>% as.data.frame()
rownames(df1) <- c()
colnames(df1) <- c('eggs','flour','milk')
df1 <- df1 %>% mutate(cost = eggs*1.93 + flour*0.33 + milk*3.48)

df1

```

The cost of one customer's goods are printed.
This is sort of a bad example because this can all easily be done in a python dataframe. OR a matrix of costs can be multiplied with a matrix of the number of each item.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```
